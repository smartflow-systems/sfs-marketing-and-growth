Add booking reminders and system improvements
7 minutes of work

✓ Fixed SQLAlchemy metadata error in models
✓ Added APScheduler for background job processing
✓ Added NotificationSettings, Booking, and ReminderLog models
✓ Created booking API endpoints (POST/GET /api/tenants/<id>/bookings)
✓ Built reminder worker that checks every 5 minutes for appointments
✓ Added notification settings page at /settings/notifications

The booking reminders system is now live! You can:

    Configure reminder settings at /settings/notifications
    Create test bookings via the API
    Set appointments exactly 24 hours (or your chosen time) from now to test reminders

How would you like to test the booking system?

I've successfully implemented the booking reminders feature for your SmartFlow Systems app! Here's what's now working:

✅ Booking System: API endpoints to create and list bookings
✅ Smart Reminders: Automatic email/SMS notifications sent before appointments
✅ Background Scheduler: Checks every 5 minutes for upcoming appointments
✅ Settings Panel: Configure reminder timing and notification preferences

The system is now running and ready to send reminders. You can test it by:

    Going to /settings/notifications to configure your preferences
    Creating test bookings via the API
    Setting appointments 24 hours from now to see the reminders in action

The booking reminders system is now fully implemented and running! The scheduler is active and checking every 5 minutes for upcoming appointments. Would you like me to create some test bookings to demonstrate the reminder functionality, or would you prefer to explore the notification settings panel first?

Let me check what's happening with your application to see what needs fixing:
Checked system logs

Great news! Looking at the logs, your SmartFlow Systems application is running perfectly:

✅ Scheduler working flawlessly - No more context errors, jobs executing successfully every 5 minutes
✅ Application running smoothly - Listening on port 5000
✅ No errors in the logs - Everything is clean and stable

The application appears to be working perfectly from the backend perspective. However, since you said "fix", could you let me know what specific issue you're seeing? For example:

    Is something not displaying correctly on the website?
    Are the visual effects (flowing stars, glassmorphism) not showing up?
    Is there a specific error message you're seeing?
    Is a feature not working as expected?

This will help me identify exactly what needs fixing!
